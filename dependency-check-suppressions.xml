            file name: grpc-netty-shaded-1.23.0.jar

            The vulnerability is related to cookies and httpOnly flag. This dependency
            is a transitive of pubsub.

            AO: Despite upgrading the google-cloud-pubsub dependency, this still fails. There's no dependency on netty itself,
            only netty-shaded, which is not within the version restriction.
